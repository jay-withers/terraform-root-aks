# graph-building overhead, not network time. Azure/naming/azurerm has no
# resources of its own to scan, so the trade was pure cost for zero benefit
# here. Revisit if the module tree grows to include modules with real
# resources; checkov will keep logging a "Failed to download module" warning
# in the meantime, which is expected and harmless.
